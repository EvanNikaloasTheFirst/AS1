This is a Web programming project I completed in the first semester assigment in my second year.
I was tasked with creating functionality into the backend of the website as the front end was already created.
It is an auction style website where we was tasked with duties mainly 
- Using POST/GET request to send and retrieve data from the backend 
We had to:
- Create accounts
- Create listings
- Allow certain users access to specific areas of the websites depending on the type of access
that there were given from the database.

We used PHP 8.1 as the logic for the website (Logic, POST/GET requests) and we used MySQL 
to store data into our database
